                        With a double-digit growth rate will continue, as everything indicates, <a href="https://www.europack.gr" className='text-blue-500' >Europack</a> in 2025, even adding new partnerships to its customer base.
                    </span> 
                    <span>
                        As stated to <a href="https://www.fnbdaily.com/" className='text-blue-500' >FnB Daily</a>, Alexandros Paraskevaidis CEO of the company which is active in industrial production and packaging equipment, as well as with packaging itself, 
                        "the last years we have been running with double-digit growth rates and with the same pattern we will move this year, closing 2025 with an increase in sales between 10% and 13%".

                        THE ROLE OF CUSTOMERS EXPORT ORIENTATION
                    </span> 
                    <span>
                        Key to the company's momentum is, as he notes, the fact that "we are engaged and have many partnerships in the food and pharmaceutical sectors, 
                        which, as expected, have shown strong resistance even in the difficult period of the pandemic while maintaining a strong export orientation". Beyond turnover, he adds, 'we are seeing an overall increase in our activity, having more medium and large projects and fewer small ones.

                    </span> 
                    <span>
                        Setting the tone of the year that ends in a few weeks, Mr. Paraskevaidis speaks of "a return of the market to high quality equipment as the fastest growing extroverted industries need high quality infrastructure and services to support both their sales and brand". One of the products that has particular dynamic in this period is yogurt, in which, as Mr. Paraskevaidis mentions, “as <a href="https://www.europack.gr" className='text-blue-500' >Europack</a> we are very well positioned by providing both packaging machines and end of line solutions”.

                    <span>
                        "Of course, Greek yogurt is nothing new", notes <a href="https://www.europack.gr" className='text-blue-500' >Europack</a> CEO, adding: "What is new is the recognition it has gained abroad at a time when consumers are looking for alternative sources of protein instead of meat. In fact, whereas until recently it was treated as a dessert, consumers now see it as a snack or, in some cases, even a meal. This changes drive more sales and export activity to Greek industries". In fact, he notes that there is a strong tendency to increased size of the packaging: "It is characteristic that at the moment the 500gr pack is more attractive than the 200gr pack".

                    <span>
                        A second area in which the company is developing its customer base is that of pharmaceuticals. 'This is perhaps the most dynamically growing industry at the moment in our country with a very serious international footprint. And there we are very well positioned with leading suppliers and reliable solutions which is reflected in repeated orders", Mr. Paraskevaidis is highlighting.

                    <span>
                        oreover, the mobility of the coffee sector has also been a catalyst for <a href="https://www.europack.gr" className='text-blue-500' >Europack</a> 's growth. "Recently some new, more modern and automated process sites are under development. With the representation of Probat, one of the leading and most historic companies in coffee processing, we can provide leading-edge solutions", he emphasises.
                    </span> 
                    <span>
                        It should be noted that <a href="https://www.europack.gr" className='text-blue-500' >Europack</a> is more than 50 years in the market (founded in 1972), has 20 employees and a technical department capable of supporting the introduction and maintenance of its solutions into the market. At the same time, according to Mr. Paraskevaidis, it also has the ability to design entire production lines as well as build them through collaborations with Greek workshops - "something that gives us the ability to undertake and deliver projects... on a turnkey basis".

          The Greek company <a href="https://www.damavand.gr/" className="text-blue-600" > Damavand </a>  , a renowned company in the Greek tomato industry, is bolstering its long-standing partnership with SIG and Europack, SIG's Greek representative, as it upgrades its production facility in Filia, Karditsa in central Greece. <br />
          The food manufacturer has invested for the future by installing a new cutting-edge SIG Compact 12 Aseptic Food filling machine for aseptic cartons to enhance its operational efficiency and unlock new levels of flexibility and product innovation.        
          </span>

        <span>
          SIG’s food filling technology puts Damavand in a strong competitive position, as it gets ready to broaden and innovate its growing product range. The new high speed and flexible SIG Compact 12 Aseptic Food enables Damavand to fill up to seven different volume sizes, ranging from 200ml to 500ml, on one and the same filling machine with a capacity to fill 12,000 packs per hour – combining flexibility and speed. What makes this technology unique is its ability to process a wide range of different food products on a single machine, including products with chunk sizes up to 25mm, fibers up to 40mm, up to 50% particulate content and viscosities of up to 5,000 mPas. 
          Furthermore, the semi-automatic cleaning reduces downtime per cleaning cycle by three minutes.        
          </span>

        <span>
          Vasilis Xarchas, Head of Sales at Damavand: “The new SIG filling technology is a crucial investment for Damavand, as it allows us to expand our production capacity and further enhance our diverse product portfolio with new and exciting tomato-based products, complementing our traditional ‘passata,’ ‘chopped,’ and ‘finely chopped/crushed’ products. Building on years of successful collaboration with leading retailers across Europe, we’re now in a position to meet their growing demand for added-value products like pasta and pizza sauces, leveraging our deep expertise to conceptualize entirely new products, test their viability, and provide unique solutions from inception to shelf.”          
        </span>

        <span>
          SIG and Damavand have shared a strong and enduring partnership for more than 25 years. SIG offers a unique technology enabling food manufacturers to aseptically fill a huge variety of products into aseptic cartons. The key enabler is SIG’s sleeve-based carton filling technology, where each carton sleeve is individually shaped, sterilized and filled on SIG filling machines which have an industry-leading waste rate of less than 0.5%. After the filling process, the carton packs are ultrasonically sealed above the filling level and not through the product. This prevents particulates or fibbers getting trapped in the sealed seam – a vital benefit for aseptic product safety. The results are high-quality products that can be stored for long periods without the need for preservatives or refrigeration.        
        </span>

        <span>
          Omar Gastaldo, Head of Sales Greece and Israel at SIG: “We are delighted about the positive development of our collaboration with Damavand. We are confident that, with the integration of the state-of-the-art SIG Compact 12 Aseptic Food filling machine at their Filia site, Damavand will expand its range of products in SIG carton packs well ahead of the 2026 tomato crop season.”        
        </span>

        <span>
          In addition to the new SIG Compact 12 Aseptic Food, Damavand also operates a SIG Standard 12 Aseptic with Food Option kit. Together, these two complementary filling machines provide the flexibility to aseptically fill a wide range of products in carton packs, covering volumes from 200ml up to 1 liter. And thanks to their ability to switch seamlessly between different volumes and to offer a wide range of customized product recipes, Damavand can deliver the highest standards of quality and food safety – all while maintaining the production efficiency that drives its success.        
        </span>

        <span>
          Damavand's long lasting collaboration with SIG and Europack is based on innovation, safety, and quality. SIG's advanced aseptic packaging technology ensures minimum production waste percentages and allows the production of high quality products that are preserved for long periods without preservatives or refrigeration.

          In today's market, all stakeholders, from manufacturers to large distributors and, of course, consumers, are fully aware of <strong> the importance of issues related to sustainability </strong>  and better use of resources and are consequently directing their actions in all areas towards reducing their environmental impact.
          This mission has always been an integral part of the journey of SIG, a leader in aseptic packaging with a broad portfolio of packaging solutions ranging from aseptic beverage cartons to spouted pouch and bag-in-box.
          “SIG is not limited to supplying packaging," explains <strong> Giovanni Micheletto SIG's Managing SIG for Italy, Spain and South-East Europe,</strong>,  "but we also provide the filler and technical support”.        
          </span>

        <span>
         <strong> Before we move on to sustainability, how would you sum up the main characteristics of SIG; </strong> 
          One of our key words is <strong>"flexibility"</strong> A word that, as those who know us well know, is almost an obsession. Let me give you an example from the world of aseptic beverage cartons, our traditional business: on the same filling machine, our customers can fill packages with different volumes and in some cases even different formats and shapes, with machine changes taking just a few minutes and without compromising production efficiency in any way.    
          </span>

        <span>
         <strong>How are flexibility and sustainability linked for SIG; </strong> 
          We have developed a special portfolio called <strong>SIG Terra, </strong>  which offers our customers even more sustainable options. For example, when we talk about carton packaging, we can offer <strong>packaging for long-life products without aluminium and/or linked to forest-based polymers. </strong>  And then we come to flexibility, because these packs can be used on exactly the same filler that our customers already use, and they can also alternate these structures with the standard ones.        
          </span>

        <span>
        <strong> Very interesting, especially the aluminium-free aspect. Can you give us any further details?</strong>  
          SIG has been able to offer an aseptic aluminium-free cardboard package for milk and cooking cream since 2010.And we recently celebrated the sale of  <strong>3 billion aluminium-free packages in Europe.</strong> An achievement that makes us very proud! And as a further step forward, we have recently launched an innovation, SIG Terra Alu-free Full Barrier, which allows us to expand the product categories, adding juices and plant-based drinks to milk and cream, and this without compromising shelf-life and product quality.        
        </span>

          The greatest strategic challenge for industry is the ability to stay ahead of technological developments in the face of serious geopolitical instability. The same applies to the ones supplying the industry, such as EUROPACK I.S.        
          </span>

        <span>
          A key factor in the progress of innovations and advancement is the availability of suitably trained and eager staff. In addition, continuous updating and exploration of the applications of new technologies in the activity can ensure both its sustainability and extroversion.
          In particular, the sector of food and other product packaging equipment, in which Europack has been active for 53 years, needs to adapt to the new EU directives on the environment and packaging. Developments that require new approaches, technologies and materials. Europack also covers the final inspection of packaging and food with high-tech solutions.        
        </span>

        <span>
          The lack of manpower and expertise, as well as environmental requirements, are leading to an increase in the need for automation and robotic applications, as well as the need for technical support. It is a fact that the industry has a shortage of technical manpower, a gap which we are called upon to fill every day, this is why Europack is constantly investing in technical manpower and in the support of the equipment it sells.
          External factors such as energy, raw material costs, and market pressures require continuous investment in efficiency and automation to reduce production costs and energy footprint. Europack, as a supplier to industry, combines equipment and expertise to design complete lines that are at the cutting edge of technology and reliability.

            Η ΜΕΒΓΑΛ είναι γνωστή στην Ελλάδα και στο εξωτερικό για την εξαιρετική ποιότητα προϊόντων και τον σεβασμό στον καταναλωτή. Μια εταιρεία που ιδρύθηκε το 1950 στα Κουφάλια Θεσσαλονίκης, ξεκίνησε να στήνει το υπάρχον εργοστάσιο το 1967 και λανσάρισε ευρωπαϊκού τύπου γιαούρτι το 1978, λειτουργούσε μέχρι το 2017 με την μορφή του puzzle.
        </span>

        <span>
          Η εξέλιξη και η ανάπτυξη υποκινούσε τις επενδύσεις και αυτές έβρισκαν χώρο σε ένα εργοστάσιο που «φούσκωνε» σιγά σιγά. Αυτό γίνεται πάντα όταν ένας χώρος σχεδιάζεται χωρίς να γνωρίζει ο επιχειρηματίας τι εξέλιξη θα έχει στο μέλλον και με ποιο τρόπο η τεχνολογία θα επηρεάσει τις εγκαταστάσεις του.    
        </span>

        <span>
          Επίσης, η εταιρεία έκανε διαχρονικά επενδύσεις σε υψηλή τεχνολογία προσπαθώντας να είναι ένα βήμα μπροστά. Έτσι ήταν η πρώτη στην Ελλάδα που εγκατέστησε πλήρως ασηπτική μηχανή γιαούρτης το 1991, από τον οίκο Gasti Γερμανίας.
        </span>

        <span>
            Σε αυτό βοήθησε ότι στην ΜΕΒΓΑΛ υπήρχε και υπάρχει διοίκηση που γνωρίζει πολύ καλά τόσο το προϊόν, όσο και τις ανάγκες του καταναλωτή.
        </span>

        <span>
            Το 2016, η εταιρεία πήρε την απόφαση να μετατρέψει την συσκευασία γιαούρτης σε μια σύγχρονη μονάδα, που θα μπορεί να αποτελέσει βιτρίνα και βάση για επέκταση των εξαγωγών, που σήμερα πλέον έχουν φτάσει να καλύπτουν το 37% του τζίρου της.
        </span>

        <span>
            Ήταν σαφές από την αρχή ότι ο χώρος συσκευασίας δεν ήταν επαρκής για μια ορθολογική και αυτοματοποιημένη λύση και για αυτό δόθηκε ένας πρόσθετος χώρος ακριβώς πάνω από τον υπάρχοντα.
        </span>

        <span>
            Η Europack IS, παλιός συνεργάτης της ΜΕΒΓΑΛ στην προμήθεια υψηλής ποιότητας εξοπλισμού συσκευασίας και μετασυσκευασίας γιαούρτης, επελέγη ως ο Τεχνικός Σύμβουλος για τον σχεδιασμό της νέας εγκατάστασης Συμμετείχε συγκεκριμένα στην διαμόρφωση μιας ροής παραγωγής, που είχε σαν στόχο να μειώσει τις άσκοπες μετακινήσεις και να αυτοματοποιήσει τις διάφορες λειτουργίες, με αποτέλεσμα την βελτίωση της τελικής ποιότητας του προϊόντος και τη μείωση του κόστους λειτουργίας.
        </span>

        <span>
           Στη διάρκεια του σχεδιασμού θα έπρεπε να αντιμετωπιστούν και ξεπεραστούν πολλές δυσκολίες σε θέματα απόδοσης, υγιεινής και τεχνολογίας, που όμως είχαν επιτυχή κατάληξη.
        </span>

        <span>
           Ο σχεδιασμός έγινε σε συνεργασία και ακολουθώντας τις κατευθύνσεις που έθεσε η τεχνική και παραγωγική ομάδα της ΜΕΒΓΑΛ :
           <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>On line παραγωγή μέχρι τελικό προϊόν (συμπεριλαμβανομένης και της πολυσυσκευασίας) </li>
            <li>Μείωση εσωτερικών μεταφορών</li>
            <li>Δυνατότητα αυτοματοποίησης μέχρι και την παλέτα</li>
            <li>Αύξηση παραγωγικής δυνατότητας σε ειδικές συσκευασίες</li>
            <li>Αύξηση του επιπέδου υγιεινής με την δημιουργία πιστοποιημένου χώρου συσκευασίας clean area ISO</li>
            <li>Η τελική διάταξη προέκυψε μετά από λεπτομερή μελέτη του χώρου, των αναγκών αλλά και των  δυνατοτήτων να εκτελεστεί το έργο, χωρίς το εργοστάσιο να διακόψει την παραγωγική του λειτουργία. Επίσης, ο σχεδιασμός υλοποίησης έγινε σε βήματα και με πλήρη έλεγχο της εξέλιξης, ώστε να μην διαταραχθεί η παράδοση των προϊόντων στην αγορά.</li>
           </ul>
        </span>

        <span>
           Η Europack IS σχεδίασε τον χώρο και την τοποθέτηση του εξοπλισμού υφιστάμενου και καινούργιου, με τρόπο τέτοιο που να καλύπτονται οι ανωτέρω απαιτήσεις.
        </span>

        <span>
           Για την εκτέλεση του έργου συνεργάστηκαν Ελληνικές εταιρείες με μακρόχρονη εμπειρία στην Γαλακτοβιομηχανία και στις εγκαταστάσεις εξοπλισμού τροφίμων, έτσι:
           <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Τον καθαρό χώρο (clean room) σχεδίασε και κατασκεύασε η εταιρεία Στεφάτος. </li>
            <li>Τα καινούργια δίκτυα και τις μετακινήσεις των μηχανημάτων, όπως και την επανασύνδεση τους στο νέο χώρο συσκευασίας, σχεδίασε και εκτέλεσε η Engineering Solutions των Ιωάννου – Γαλάζιου </li>
            <li>Τις μεταφορικές ταινίες και τα καταβατόρια για την σύνδεση των ορόφων, κατασκεύασε και τοποθέτησε η Μεταφοροτεχνικά – Ραψανιώτης.</li>
            <li>Τον πρόσθετο εξοπλισμό εγκιβωτισμού και τις μονάδες παλετοποίησης, η Condor Robotics.</li>
            <li>Η συλλογή και καταγραφή των πραγματικών δεδομένων παραγωγής (υλικών, προϊόντων, ωρών, προσωπικού, δυναμικότητας, κλπ.) έγινε από την ACMON DATA.</li>
           </ul>

           Ένα έργο που έδωσε την δυνατότητα στην εταιρεία να ελέγξει κόστος και ποιότητα, να δώσει μια εικόνα εξέλιξης και σύγχρονης τεχνολογίας αλλά και να αποκτήσει πλήρη έλεγχο της παραγωγής και του κόστους λειτουργίας.

            Ο κ. Κωνσταντίνος Χατζάκος, Διευθύνων Σύμβουλος της εταιρείας που συνεχίζει την παρακαταθήκη του ομώνυμου ιδρυτή, αναφέρει:
            «Με την ανάληψη της Διοίκησης σε μια δύσκολη περίοδο για την εταιρεία, δώσαμε βαρύτητα στην ανάπτυξη της με βασικούς πυλώνες στη προσπάθεια αυτή, το ελληνικό γιαούρτι και την ελληνική φέτα, στα οποία η εταιρεία μας έχει μεγάλη παράδοση και τεχνογνωσία.
            Είναι δύο προϊόντα που έχουν έντονη εξωστρέφεια και θεωρούνται πρεσβευτές της χώρας μας σε όλο τον κόσμο.
            Έτσι πήραμε την απόφαση να εκσυγχρονίσουμε τις εγκαταστάσεις και τον εξοπλισμό για την παραγωγή τους, ώστε να αναβαθμίσουμε περαιτέρω την ήδη καλή ποιότητα τους και να παραμείνουμε πρωτοπόροι σε μια αγορά με έντονο ανταγωνισμό.
            Ξεκινώντας από το γιαούρτι αποφασίσαμε να συνεργαστούμε στη σχεδίαση των νέων εγκαταστάσεων και την υλοποίηση τους με τους καλύτερους και πλέον έμπειρους στο χώρο αυτό, όπως η εταιρία Europack IS με σημαντική τεχνογνωσία και καινοτόμα σκέψη και τελικά το αποτέλεσμα μας δικαίωσε σε όλους τους τομείς, εισπράττοντας τα οφέλη της σύγχρονης τεχνολογίας και επιτυγχάνοντας όλους τους στόχους που αναφέρθηκαν παραπάνω».
